    <p>Aloha. I'm originally from Hawaii, but I've lived in Las Vegas 
    for 25 years. I am divorced and have 3 dogs, sometimes 4.</p>
    <p>I just graduated from BYU Pathway-Connect, and I loved it.
    I first signed up for the accounting cert, because that's what I
    currently do at my job. But after taking the class, which I liked,
    I decided to drop accounting and move to computer design.
    I'd like to eventually leave my job so why would I learn
    something I already do. (I work as an office/accounting manager.)
    I like my job, but I want something different.</p> 
    <p>My goal is to graduate with a bachelors in technology and explore the world of
    creativity using computers. I don't know exactly what field yet because I know so little
    about what I'm doing right now, but I'm going to try my best.</p>
    <p>So I'm typing this and I have less than 15 min. before it's due. (I had a dog/vet emergency today.)</p>
    <p>I am going to proudly humble brag
    that Live Server wasn't there when I right-clicked so I looked it up and downloaded the extension.
    Also, there is a red h2 that I can't get rid of and my name kept showing up in small letters on the 
    right side of the pic. So after typing it again multiple times and it didn't work, I just left it blank
    after the red h2 and typed another h2 below that and now it works. I may be older than y'awl but I'm stubborn.</p>
    <p>And. . . right after I humble bragged, BYU page is not loading and I can't get on to our module to upload this, and now my assignment is late.
        Plus why are all of my lines going so far across the page? 
    </p>
    <p>If you need me, I'll be at my favorite place . . . at a park with my dogs. Great de-stresser for these kinds of episodes.</p>
