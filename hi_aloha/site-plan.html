      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p class="site_plan"> I want to help people make the most of their Hawaii trip by giving them an insider's opinion of the best places to visit. As a Native Hawaiian and a former tour guide, 
          I can offer advice on things like the best hikes, the best beaches, the best scenic areas, the best restaurants, and the best shows to watch.

      <p class="headline"> Aw, I Missed That! </p>
      <p>
      Have you ever visited somewhere great, then found out later that you missed about 20 things that you should have done, but didn’t know about? I hear that
      all the time about Hawaii, and with today’s prices, not many people can afford to go back to Hawaii for a do-over.  (Which reminds me of an old tour guide joke. 
      I'd tell a bus full of people, "Stand up if this is your first time to Hawaii. Everyone, these people (standing) are what we call ‘malihini’s’ meaning first-timer.
      Now stand up if this is your second time to Hawaii. Everyone, these people are what we call ‘kama’aina’ meaning local. Now stand up if you’ve visited Hawaii 
      three or more times. Okay everyone, take a good look at these people standing up. These people are what we call RICH." Gets a laugh every time. 
      Ah, the good ol' days when I could make fun of white people. Good times.
      </p>
      <br><p class="headline"> "Forced" to go on Dinner Cruises. In Other Words, I was a Tour Guide</p>
      <p>
      When I was a tour guide, nothing made me happier than to escort a bus full of tired, sunburned, and happy tourists back to the airport for their flight home.  
      I loved helping people make the most of their visit to Hawaii.  I’ve been working with tourists since before I was born.  My mom was an entertainer at the famed 
      Coco Palms hotel on Kauai, the site of Elvis Presley’s movie, “Hawaii”.  Since I was born and raised in Hawaii, on the islands of Kauai and Oahu, I thought I’d
      offer my advice on some of the best things to do and see while you’re on Kauai or Oahu.  I was also a tour guide so I could recommend the best shows to see.  
      (I was forced to go to every show, every luau, and every dinner cruise.  These were called “fams” and were a mandatory part of my job.  I remember going on my
      first sunset dinner cruise and not believing that I was actually at work. But by the 3rd week of sunset dinner cruises, I was complaining about it.  
      Having worked in an office for the last 30 years, I’d trade places with my younger self in a heartbeat, if it didn’t pay so poorly.  By the way, don’t forget to tip 
      your tour guide and bus driver, especially if they’re funny, and most of us are.  
      </p>
     
      <br><p class="headline"> My Two Cents </p>
      <p>
      So, for what it’s worth, I’d like to show you the places that I think you should visit while on your Hawaiian vacation.  
      I want you to be able to say, “Yes, I went there!” instead of “Aw, I missed that!”  
      I’ll have links to other websites that you can book a tour through, or that gives you more information on the subject.  For instance, I’ve listed the best hikes on Oahu, 
      and there’s a link to alltrails.com which will give you much more detailed information on each hike than I can. (These sites have done all the research and all the work, 
      they deserve the visit. Also please note that I am not being paid for recommending their site.)

      <h3>Oahu</h3>
      <p>
        Oahu, the “Gathering Place” is Hawaii’s main island and the most populous. 69% of the total population of Hawaii live on the island of Oahu.  
        Oahu is also the United States' military hub of the pacific.  It houses all branches of the armed forces.  Prior to social media, people who’ve never 
        visited Hawaii before used to assume we all speak Hawaiian and live in grass huts. I once had someone ask me if they could use their “American money” in Hawaii. 
        But those malihinis (first timers) change their mind real quick on their descent into Daniel K. Inouye International Airport. Landing in Honolulu reminds me of entering
        the Hawaiian version of New York City. But while Oahu is the hub of the state and rush hour traffic is horrendous, there is also the other side of the island,
         which is where Oahu looks like what people think Hawaii looks like.  There is the drive to the north shore, a 30-mile drive right along the beach, where the exit from
         the Likelike tunnel overlooking Kaneohe will take your breath away.  Driving on the H-3 freeway right smack in between two mountains will make you like driving on 
         freeways.  Oahu, though busy, has a lot to offer a visitor from the “mainland”.  You just have to find the right things to do.

      <h3>Kaua'i</h3>
      <p>
        Kaua'i, the “Garden Island”, is very slow compared to Oahu. While Oahu houses 69% of Hawaii’s population, Kaua'i houses 4%, or approximately 58,000 people. 
        Fun fact: Billboards are illegal anywhere in Hawaii. But on Kauai, there is the added law that no building on the island can be taller than a coconut tree, 
        or the equivalent of four stories.  It’s called the coconut tree law.  (A 9-story hotel was built in the 1960s and the coconut tree law was put into place 
        so that it wouldn’t happen again.)  Go to Kauai when you want to leave the world behind.  Kauai is for the nature and outdoors enthusiast.  Some of the most 
        beautiful hiking trails in the world are on Kauai, not to mention some of the most beautiful beaches.  You can go kayaking, snorkeling, parasailing, hiking, 
        and ziplining all in one day. Outdoor fun awaits you on the Island of Kaua'i!
