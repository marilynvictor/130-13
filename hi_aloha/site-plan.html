      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p class="site_plan"> I want to help people make the most of their Hawaii trip by giving them an insider's opinion of the best places to visit. As a Native Hawaiian and a former tour guide, 
          I can offer advice on things like the best hikes, the best beaches, the best scenic areas, the best restaurants, and the best shows to watch.

      <p class="headline"> Aw, I Missed That! </p>
      <p>
      Have you ever visited somewhere great, then found out later that you missed about 20 things that you could have done, but didn’t know about? I hear that
      all the time about Hawaii, and with today’s prices, not many people can afford to go back to Hawaii for a do-over.  (Which reminds me of an old tour guide joke. 
      I'd tell a bus full of people, "Stand up if this is your first time to Hawaii. Everyone, these people (standing) are what we call ‘malihini’s’ meaning first-timer.
      Now stand up if this is your second time to Hawaii. Everyone, these people are what we call ‘kama’aina’ meaning local. Now stand up if you’ve visited Hawaii 
      three or more times. Okay everyone, take a good look at these people standing up. These people are what we call RICH." Gets a laugh every time. 
      Ah, the good ol' days when we would make fun of white people. Good times.
      </p>
      <br><p class="headline"> I Took Sunset Dinner Cruises every night. In Other Words, I was a Tour Guide</p>
      <p>
      I’ve been working with tourists since before I was born.  My mom was an entertainer at the famed 
      Coco Palms hotel on Kaua'i, the site of Elvis Presley’s movie, “Blue Hawaii” and I danced hula there as soon as I could walk.  Naturally, one of my first jobs when I grew up was as a tour guide. Since I was born and raised in Hawaii, specifically on the islands of Kauai and Oahu, 
      and since I've been a tour guide, I thought that I could offer my advice on some of the best things to do and see while you’re on Kaua'i or Oahu.  Nothing makes me happier than to see a bus full of happy, slightly sunburned, and tired tourists on their way home after a fabulous vacation in Hawaii. 
      
      </p>
     
      <br><p class="headline"> My Two Cents </p>
      <p>
      So, for what it’s worth, I made a list of places that I think you should visit while on your Hawaiian vacation.  
      I want you to be able to say, “Yes, I went there!” instead of “Aw, I missed that!”  
      I have links to other websites that you can book a tour through, or that gives you more information on the subject.  For instance, I’ve listed the best hikes on Oahu, 
      and there’s a link to alltrails.com which will give you much more detailed information on each hike than I can. (These sites have done all the research and all the work, 
      they deserve the visit. Full disclosure: I am not being paid for recommending these sites.)

      <h3>Oahu</h3>
      <p>
        Oahu, "The Gathering Place". Prior to social media, people who had never visited Hawaii before used to assume we all speak Hawaiian and live in grass huts. I once had someone ask me if they could use their “American money” in Hawaii. 
        But those malihinis (first-timers) change their mind real quick upon their descent into the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport. Landing in Honolulu reminds me of entering
        a mini New York City. But while Oahu is the most populous island with almost a million people, and is the hub of the state and rush hour traffic is horrendous, there is also the other side of the island,
         which is where Oahu looks like what people think Hawaii looks like.  Once you go up Likelike Highway and come out on the other side of the Wilson tunnel, the view will take your breath away. Then there is the road to the north shore, a 30-mile drive with the mountains on your left, and the ocean on your right.
         Even driving on the H-3 freeway is downright scenic. Oahu, though busy, has a lot to offer a visitor from the “mainland”.  You just have to find the right things to do. 
        Magic Island Lagoon: All the locals love Magic Island. It's a beach right next to Ala Moana that has a reef. So it's a great place to swim that's relatively safe from the currents.
        Ala Moana Beach Park: I love Ala Moana Beach Park in the late afternoons. Every afternoon about 5 p.m. or so, my friends and I would go running/walking around the park 
        and after when we were all sweaty and ready to drop, we'd jump in the ocean. Oh, that was the best. There is almost no better site in the world than being in the warm water 
        watching the sunset.  
        Kailua Beach:  Kailua Beach is on the Windward side of the island and if you want to see the "real Hawaii", go there.  It's a beautiful beach that's has nice sandy places to set up your
        towel or blanket. It's also got great views of the small islands right off of Oahu. But DON'T swim to the islands. They look close, but people don't realize how far swimming 
        a mile really is. 
        Polynesian Cultural Center (PCC): PCC is my absolute favorite of all of the shows and activities in Hawaii.  For PCC, it's an all-day activity. You have to get there at
        least by 1 p.m.  What you do is walk around to all of the different Polynesian villages that they have. You'll learn about each culture at the different villages 
        and each has different activities that you can do. Don't miss the Samoan village.  It is by far the best. After you walk around to all the villages, you might even be
        able to catch a ceremony or two in the lagoon.  After that, you'll have a luau and the food is great.  Then comes the show. The night show is the best in Hawaii. 
        There are at least 100 dancers in the show.  It's colorful and very entertaining. Plus if you go to PCC, you'll be helping a college kid, did you know that? BYU is right
        next door and every student who needs a job, is given a job at PCC.  If you can dance, you're in the show.  If you can't, you're in the ticket booth, or somewhere on the 
        property doing something.  If you can, take a tour bus there.  That way you can be entertained by the bus driver as you're being driven the 30 miles to the venue.
        Kualoa Ranch: I have a personal connection with this ranch.  I went to elementary school with a girl who lived at the ranch. They brought the entire class to the ranch
        one year to ride horses. It was great. So Kualoa Ranch, in between renting out their ranch to various TV and film crews (Jurassik Park, Jurassik World, Lost, Godzilla, 50 First Dates)
        they offer different activities. You could do an Ebike tour, you could do an ATV tour, they even offer tours to show you where the Jurassic movies were filmed.
        It's a family friendly environment and I recommend it.  
        There are so many things to do and see on Oahu that I'm just going to give you a quick note or two about why I like these things to do:
        Pearl Harbor: This is a good place to visit to re-energize your love for America. The Arizona memorial is called that because it's built right over the sunken
        ship Arizona, that went down during the invasion of Pearl Harbor. Please be respectful when you go there, don't wear a bikini, for instance. This memorial is to 
        remember those who died fighting for their country. If you take a bus tour, they'll also combine this with a tour of Honolulu City.

      <h3>Kaua'i</h3>
      <p>
        Kaua'i, the “Garden Island”, is very slow compared to Oahu. While Oahu houses 69% of Hawaii’s population, Kaua'i houses 4%, or approximately 58,000 people. 
        Fun fact: Billboards are illegal anywhere in Hawaii. But on Kauai, there is the added law that no building on the island can be taller than a coconut tree, 
        or the equivalent of four stories.  It’s called the coconut tree law.  (A 9-story hotel was built in the 1960s and the coconut tree law was put into place 
        so that it wouldn’t happen again.)  Kauai is where you go when you want to leave the world behind.  Kaua'i is for the nature and outdoors enthusiast.  Some of the most 
        beautiful hiking trails in the world are on Kaua'i, not to mention some of the most beautiful beaches.  You can go kayaking, snorkeling, parasailing, hiking, 
        and ziplining all in one day. Outdoor fun awaits you on the Island of Kaua'i!
